# Orderus

A dummy project in NestJS to explore and learn Dapr — demonstrating Pub/Sub, State Store, and Service Invocation patterns.

## 📦 What is this

`Orderus` is a sample microservice-style application built with NestJS + TypeScript — designed as a playground to experiment with Dapr building‑blocks.  
It implements a basic ordering system composed of:  
- An **Orders** Service — to manage orders 
- A skeleton **Notifications** Service — to support eventual notification workflows  
- Integration with Dapr for event publishing (Pub/Sub), state management and service orchestration  

Use it as a sandbox to test Dapr patterns, microservice interactions, and Docker‑based service orchestration.
